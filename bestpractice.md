# Introduction
We would like to have a `best practise` document for working with the two [Bruker](http://bruker-microct.com/) microCT machines ([1272](http://bruker-microct.com/products/1272.htm) and [1172](http://bruker-microct.com/products/1172.htm)) here at the [Institute of Anatomy](http://ana.unibe.ch).
This document should describe how we would like to work with the machines.

# Scanning
- Clean the tables!
- Avoid bringing dust into the room
